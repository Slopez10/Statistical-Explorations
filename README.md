- Descriptive_Stats (1)
    - This notebook explores basic descriptive statistics by looking at a dataset that contains a sample of humans. These data are completely real. They were obtained from [BMI Data][http://mreed.umtri.umich.edu/mreed/downloads.html#ansur2] and were acquired as part of the 1988 U.S. Army Anthropometry survey. They consist of data from men and women of the armed forces. For each person, the dataset records sex, height in cm, weight in kg, and BMI index. Note: the original dataset contained height in millimeters and weight in decagrams. An instructor from Mississippi State University, Jonathan Barlow, performed the units conversions and calculated the BMI.
